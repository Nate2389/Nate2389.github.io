  My second year of my Information Technology Pathway in High School focuses on the advanced coding language with the JavaScript Language. During the year we were taught how to develop front end web applications. Our final project of the year was to create a functional website. I came up with a idea of using my prior knowledge to create a functional website to order food. Which I named the "Pandaless Express"(Please don't copy right me @<a href ="https://www.pandaexpress.com">Panda Express</a>) It was a online store that had 6 food items and a choice to pick how much you would like of this dish. 

Once you have decide you well then press the add button to add it to your list. The list will show up at the bottom and display the total cost of the items you have selected. 

Once your done ordering you'll press on the "Order Now" button to proceed to the final step of the order. You'll be brought to another page which displays "See Order" button to see order and a tip option. If you decide to tip then the percentage tip will be added to the total ammount. Once your done you can return to the home page by clicking on "Return to home page". And thats it.
