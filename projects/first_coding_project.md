summary: "My very first coding project was to code a online shop with HTML and CSS."

This brings back to my High School years where I took my very first coding class. The first year class taught students about HTML, CSS, and some python.Our first project was to use HTML and CSS to develop a shopping website of your choice. Requirements were to have home page, an about me(the website) page, a page of things you were selling at your shop. I decide to develop a website to sell different types of chocolate. For example, Hersey Chocolates, Nesus Chocolote, and many more. It was a really fun project and it was one of the things that sparked a passion for web development or programming in genearl.
