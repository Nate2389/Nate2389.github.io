  For our final prokect for ICS 314, Software Engineering I, as a class we were divided into groups of 5-6 people and each group was tasked with different project prompts. My group was assigned the Project Club Hub. The initial problem was that students who attend UH Manoa have no idea of what clubs were offered there, RIO(Registered Independent Organizations) clubs and even clubs that aren't registered. Even if they knew about the existing clubs, they have no way of finding more information about the club, what they do, where they meet, and many more. Therefore, our project is to address those problems by creating a Club Hub application for students to browse thru a well orgnized directory of all current student clubs whether they have been registered to the RIO or not. Have a brief description of what the club is all about. Have some club information like start date and expiration date, when do they meet, where do they meet, who should they contact, some club photos, and even more. Our Club Hub Application is called Da Club.
