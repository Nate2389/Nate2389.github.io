  <h1>Why Coding Standards Essential</h1>
  <p>
  Across the various coding languages, there are many similarities and differences between them. 
  There are so many that I could address about, however If I had to choose which one to talk about it 
  is definitely on the coding standards of the language. Coding standards provide an essential tool for programmers, 
  especially for those who are new. They offer guidelines for programmers to follow making their code clean and readable. 
  With clean and readable code, other programmers are able to read and understand what your code does which is a good impression of you as a programmer. 
  Programmers who learn coding standards apprehend a good understanding of the language.

  <h1>My Experience With Coding Standards</h1>
  <p>
  In my software engineering class, we started to use an IDE called VSCode. To make life easier coding, we installed an extension called ESLint. 
  This extension provides a coding guideline for you and other developers to follow when coding. With this extension I can have a guideline for me and 
  my team to follow when we code our project. Coding standards are very important especially if it involves a large project with multiple developers. 
  When every developer follows the same guidelines, the code becomes consistent throughout the project. 
  This consistency makes it easier for other developers in your group to read and understand code, and make it easier to for further development. 
  </p>
  <h1>My Thoughts</h1>
  <p>
  I believe that this is a great tool, with the help of ESLint I can make my code clean and readable for everyone. It also prompts errors that go against the coding standards, 
  and suggest a fix solution for you to implement. However, it is a pain in the butt to fix all the errors that ESLint provides. 
  These errors can range from a small error  to a bigger error. Despite that, I believe it's a great and useful tool for me and other future developers.
