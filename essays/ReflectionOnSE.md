<h1>Software Engineering</h1>
<p>
  Throughout the semester of ICS 314, Software Engineering I, we have learned many things that contribute to our growth of becoming a software engineer. The course covered many topics essential for a software engineer, topics including Open Source Software Development, Configuration Management, Functional Programming, Development Environments, Coding Standards, User Interface Frameworks, Agile Project Management, Design Patterns, and Ethics in Software Engineering. These topics were crucial to our education of becoming a software engineer, by providing us challenges and expectations of what it's like to be a software engineer. With so many topics we have learned, there were three topics that I found interesting and really important for me in my career of software engineering. The three topics were Coding Standards, Agile Project Management, and Ethics in Software Engineering.  
</p>
<h2>Coding Standard</h2>
<p>
  One of the topics of the course was Coding Standards. It may not seem like it but Coding Standards were very important in the development of not only web applications, but all types of softwares. Coding Standards ensure that the code is consistent, clean, and easy to understand. When developers comply with coding standards, they create softwares that is easier to read, debug, and maintain. Codes that are messy and hard to understand creates difficulties for you and others especially when working in a team environment. They can lead to a lot of errors, miscommunications, and could delay the development of the software. So Coding Standards are crucial for software engineers developing web application development. Even outside of web application development, coding standards still play a very crucial role in the development. For example, in game development, coding standards ensure that game developers produce codes that are clean and easy to understand so that future implementations are easier. This is also important in large-scale projects, where there are multiple developers working on the same thing. Therefore, when developers comply with coding standards, they are able to produce high quality code that is maintainable, has few errors, and easy to understand. 
</p>
<h2>Agile Project Management</h2>
<p>
  The other topic was Agile Project Management. In a team project environment, Agile Project Management is probably the most important one. With large-scale projects, it is really important to work together with your team members. Communication is key to success and without it will lead to disaster. What is essential in Agile Project Management is breaking down the project into smaller parts. The project is broken down into a sequence of milestones, and each milestone consists of issues which are assigned to group members and progress is tracked by GitHub. This provides a more effective and efficient way for group members to progress toward their goal of the project. During this topic, we learned a style of Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. This style focuses on breaking down the milestones into specific issues where team members can keep track of who’s responsible for certain tasks. This style ensures organization and efficiency so that every aspect of the project is covered. 
  <br>
  This style of management can also be used beyond web applications. For example, in mobile development applications, Issue Driven Project Management can be implemented so that developers can maintain an organized environment ensuring that every aspect of the application is covered. This also allows groups to keep track of who’s responsible for certain tasks. If a specific code doesn’t work, members can back track by reviewing individual issues and identify the problem and resolve it. 
</p>
<h2>Ethics in Software Engineering</h2>
<p>
  Lastly, the topic about Ethics in Software Engineering. When software engineers develop any type of softwares, it is very important to understand the morals and the responsibilities that come with it. All softwares has its pros and cons, some are beneficial and some are harmful. It is important for software engineers to decide whether or not developing this software is good for the public or not. Software developers are to have ethical decision making ensuring that their softwares is to do good for the public and not cause harm. Development of any sorts of things has to be ethically considered. For example, mobile banking applications. Developers must ensure that the app is secure so that anyone other than authorized users has access to the accounts private information. They must ensure that the app is not vulnerable to any misuse or fraud, ensuring that the data is protected and kept safe. If anything is to happen, then there must be precautionary actions to prevent it from being leaked or falling into the wrong hands.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  To sum it all up, the topics provided during the course helped us build a strong foundation as software engineers. From learning about the importance of Coding Standards to the necessity of Agile Project Management and the morals and responsibilities software engineers face, we are getting one step closer to being a full fledged software engineer. These topics help prepare us for what is to come, as we continue on we are better prepared for any challenges that come our way.
