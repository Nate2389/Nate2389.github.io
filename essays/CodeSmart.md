<h1>Why Smart?</h1>
Asking questions is an essential part of human interaction. It provides a key role in communication, building relationships, and from this we learn many things. There are so many questions that are being asked and answered. Let's look at a Software engineer perspective, Is asking questions really helpful? In my opinion, Yes. Questions can really help find out the problems with our programs. With problems we can collaborate with other engineers to tackle this obstacle. However some of the questions can be helpful and some of the questions can be unhelpful. Therefore it is important to ask smart questions rather than not smart questions.

<h1>Smart:</h1>
A question I found on StackOverflow that I think is a “smart” question is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11703470/mysql-auto-increment-between-tables">MySQL auto-increment between tables.</a>
<h1>Not Smart:</h1>
A question I found on StackOverflow that I think is a “not smart” question is <a href ="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78976969/how-to-input-a-mathematical-formula-through-code">How to input a mathematical formula through code?</a> . This question was to address how to implement math courseware through code. The user asking the question didn’t know what syntax to use to write other mathematical expressions. To me it sounds like a STFW or a RTFW question.
