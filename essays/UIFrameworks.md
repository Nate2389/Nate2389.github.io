  <h2>User Interface</h2>
  <p>
We live in a world where technology has impacted almost every aspect of our lives, from how we learn and communicate to how we run businesses and access information. The element that people see and interact with in technology is known as a User Interface (UI). As the number of users dramatically increases, there is a resulting high demand for effective and innovative UIs. While every aspect you see on the screen looks appealing to the eye, behind it all lies a finite amount of code which builds the foundation of the visuals you see. 
  </p>
  <p> 
At the core of the foundation are two essential components: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets(CSS). HTML defines the structure of contents within a webpage, later displayed to the web browser. CSS enhances HTML structure making it look appealing. Together HTML and CSS form the backbone of effective and aesthetic User Interfaces. However, as time progresses, development of UIs are becoming more demanding, and design requirements are becoming more complex. Coding raw HTML and CSS can already be tedious, and when combined with the design requirements makes it even more difficult to make. Hence developers come together and create UI Frameworks. UI Frameworks is a collection of prebuilt codes and reusable components designed to help make the creation of User Interface (UIs) more efficient. There are many UI Frameworks out there and the first one I’ve learned, or am currently learning is Bootstrap.
  </p>
  <h2>My Experience with Bootstrap</h2>
  <p>
It has been a week into bootstrap and I gotta say it makes developing UIs more convenient and efficient. UI frameworks have elevated the development process by providing prebuilt and reusable components that make development of UIs easier. Learning Bootstrap is like learning a new programming language, it has its coding standard, which could prove to be challenging to learn. However, once you have understood the fundamentals of UI frameworks like Bootstrap, it’ll greatly enhance your efficiency of making user interfaces while improving the visual aspect of it. When compared to raw HTML and CSS, there are some differences between the two. UI frameworks, like Bootstrap, offer pre-built components that make development easier and more efficient. While HTML and CSS do provide the same functionality, it requires more time and effort to achieve the result. In general, when creating a web browser it is best to use UI Frameworks as it provides simplicity and efficiency in building one. 
  </p>
  <h2>My Thoughs</h2>
  <p>
In conclusion, UI Frameworks like bootstrap enhance the process of developing user interfaces for software engineers making it more simple and easy. While developing user interfaces traditionally uses HTML and CSS, they can sometimes be more challenging compared to using UI frameworks. By utilizing UI Frameworks, developers can enhance the productivity of UIs with greater ease.
