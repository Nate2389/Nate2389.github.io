We live in a world where technology has impacted almost every aspect of our lives, from how we learn and communicate to how we run businesses and access information. The element that people see and interact with in technology is known as a User Interface (UI). As the number of users dramatically increases, there is a resulting high demand for effective and innovative UIs. While every aspect you see on the screen looks appealing to the eye, behind it all lies a finite amount of code which builds the foundation of the visuals you see.

At the core of the foundation are two essential components: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets(CSS). HTML defines the structure of contents within a webpage, later displayed to the web browser. CSS enhances HTML structure making it look appealing. Together HTML and CSS form the backbone of effective and aesthetic User Interfaces. However, as time progresses, development of UIs are becoming more demanding, and design requirements are becoming more complex. Coding raw HTML and CSS can already be tedious, and when combined with the design requirements makes it even more difficult to make. Hence developers come together and create UI Frameworks. UI Frameworks is a collection of prebuilt codes and reusable components designed to help make the creation of User Interface (UIs) more efficient. There are many UI Frameworks out there and the first one Iâ€™ve learned, or am currently learning is Bootstrap.
