  <h1>UI Framework: Old vs New</h1>
  <p>
We live in a world where technology has impacted almost every aspect of our lives, from how we learn and communicate to how we run businesses and access information. The element that people see and interact with in technology is known as a User Interface (UI). As the number of users dramatically increases, there is a resulting high demand for effective and innovative UIs. While every aspect you see on the screen looks appealing to the eye, behind it all lies a finite amount of code which builds the foundation of the visuals you see.
