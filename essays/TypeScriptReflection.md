*Javascript + “===” =  TypeScript*

I have learned JavaScript before but TypeScript. It was my first time hearing TypeScript and I was excited to learn a whole entirely new programming language but also stressed about it . 
Not until I actually started to learn about TypeScript, “wait ...Hold on isn’t this JavaScript”. I was already familiar with JavaScript and TypeScript felt similar to JavaScript, therefore 
learning TypeScript went through like a breeze. Later on, I found out that TypeScript was invented to address the shortcomings of Javascript. There were a lot of new things that I learned 
going through the module ES6 provided by <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/">freecodecamp</a>. TypeScript, in my opinion, makes typing Javascript easier, quicker and catches bugs before the runtime. 

*The Coding Esports*

Athletic coding, who would have thought I would be competing to type code fast and efficiently against others in a small time duration. Not knowing what the coding prompt is and trying to do 
that in a limited amount of time, the amount of stress I have for the WOD’s. Thankfully, we were provided with practice WOD’s to prepare ourselves for what is to come. WOD’s are great, being 
able to quickly and efficiently type a functional code in a limited amount of time is a great skill to have. It is quite stressful however with much practice, we can hone our skills to be capable 
of handling situations where quick problem solving and rapid prototyping are required.
