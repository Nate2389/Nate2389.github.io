<h1>Introduction</h1>
AI serves as an important tool in education. It has enhanced my learning in many different classes, particularly in the field of Software Engineering. AI tools can assist in my projects by suggesting codes, provide helpful alternatives so that the codes are implemented the right way, and help debug problems. Some AI tools that I have used are ChatGPT and Github Copilot. These two tools have really influenced my learning process in my education and in the field of Software Engineering.
<h1>Personal Experience with AI</h1>
During my time in ICS 314, I have used AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot in assisting me in many situations involved with coding. In many situations I try not to heavily rely on the work of codes generated by AI as much as possible because if I rely too much on it then I won’t be learning anything. Therefore I attempt the problem first and if I run into problems then I’ll ask Github Copilot to debug my code. 
<h2>Experience WODs</h2>
For experience WODs, I don’t really use AI tools that much because the point of the experience WODs is to practice your skills in coding a prompt in a designated time. However, I have GitHub Copilot enabled so whenever I code, it automatically generates the next code for me. The answer to the coding prompt is provided for each experience but it is advised to first attempt it and then watch the screencast. So I first attempted the experience and if I failed to complete it in a certain time then I’ll go watch the screencast and attempt it again till I get it before the time. If the time isn’t fast enough then I’ll keep attempting it till I get a faster time.
<h2>In-class Practice WODs</h2>
During in-class Practice WODs, I give it a go and see how far I get in accomplishing the task. If I get stuck I’ll ask GitHub Copilot “How would I code this” and Copilot would generate the code and provide me with an explanation of what each line of code does. So that I’ll be able to understand the code and learn from it so next time I get the prompt or similar to it, I’ll be able to code it.
<h2>In-class WODs</h2>
In-class WODs were very challenging, we are provided with a coding prompt and we are to code it in a designated time. I first attempted the coding prompt without using AI, so I can test to see whether or not I am able to code this. As time goes by, If I am not able to code it or I am stuck, I will then ask Github Copilot for assistance. For example, WOD: Coding Standards, I used Copilot in assisting me in completing the WOD. There was a situation where I didn’t know how to implement it to find the cities with the biggest and the smallest population. So I asked Copilot “How to find the cities with the biggest and smallest population” and it generated a code for me to use. It provided specific explanations to the code which helped me complete the WOD before the timer.
<h2>Essays</h2>
For essays, I use ChatGPT to assist me in writing the essays. I usually provide the essay prompt then I’ll ask it for an essay structure on how to tackle the prompt. 
<h2>Final project</h2>
For the final project, there were some implementations that I had difficulty with so I’ll use Copilot to assist me. However, sometimes Copilot wasn’t able to help me at all so then I’ll ask ChatGPT for some assistance. Both AI code and explanations helped me to further understand the problem and were able to help in fixing the problem and getting the code to work as intended. 
<h2>Learning a concept / tutorial</h2>
Asking AI about learning a concept or a tutorial was very helpful. AI is able to provide a clear explanation to the concept/tutorial which allowed me to easily and quickly learn it. This made my learning more efficient and simpler. 
<h2>Answering a question in class or in Discord</h2>
In the context of Answering a question in class or in Discord, I didn’t really use AI. If I knew the answer to a particular question then I’ll answer it, and If I don’t know then I’ll ask the class in discord. Usually my classmates are able to answer them so I used AI for this very little. 
<h2>Asking or answering a smart-question</h2>
In this whole entire time of taking ICS 314, I usually don’t use AI to help with asking or answering a smart question. If I were to ask a smart question then I’ll just straight up go to the professor and ask it.
<h2>Coding example</h2>
If I needed an example of how to use the code for example, Underscore .pluck, then I’ll ask ChatGPT or Copilot for an example of how to correctly use the code and it’ll generate a coding example of the usage of .pluck.
<h2>Explaining code</h2>
This is mainly what I use AI tools for, explaining how certain codes work so that I can better understand it and next I’ll be able to implement it without any difficulties. 
<h2>Writing code</h2>
For writing code, I utilize both ChatGPT and Copilot to write certain codes that could possibly help me implement whatever I was trying to accomplish. Sometimes the code it writes doesn’t work so I’ll analyze the code that both AIs provided and use it to help me implement it.
<h2>Documenting code</h2>
I can’t recall anytime that I used AI to document code because I usually do it myself.
<h2>Quality assurance</h2>
I have asked Copilot many times to check what was wrong with the code I had in vscode. And it provided a clear explanation of what was the problem and how I could fix it. ESLint errors were annoying but it helped make our code look nice and visually appealing so that others are able to understand the code.
<h2>Other uses in ICS 314 not listed</h2>
I have used ChatGPT many times outside of ICS 314. ChatGPT is able to analyze the data and be able to provide or answer any questions I give it. It helps in providing an explanation to any topic I need to understand for an assignment or quiz.
<h1>Impact on Learning and Understanding</h1> 
AI has a significant impact on my learning and understanding in many classes. They have made grasping the concepts easier, solving problems, and debugging errors efficiently. However, as I said over reliance on AI can hinder independent problem solving skills and critical thinking, which highlights the importance of finding a balance between the usage of AI.
<h1></h1>Practical Applications

<h1>Challenges and Opportunities</h1>
As great 
<h1>Comparative Analysis</h1>
<h1>Future Considerations</h1>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
Reflecting on my experiences with AI in ICS 314 and all the other classes, it is without a doubt that AI tools have had a significant impact on my education by enhancing the learning experience. I am able to fully and quickly understand any prompt. However, fully relying on AI could have a negative impact on our learning as over using it could prevent us from developing essential problem-solving skills. I believe that using AI in the Software Engineering course is a good thing as it could aid in students learning, however there must be a limit of the usage of AI. Therefore, a recommendation could be to limit the use of AI as it could potentially harm our learning environment.
