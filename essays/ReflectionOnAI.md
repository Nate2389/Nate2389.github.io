<h1> Coding World </h1>
The 21st century is regarded by many as the digital age, a period where digital technology has had a profound impact on every aspect of our lives. Everywhere we go we can see what technology has had an impact on. From the way we communicate with, learn, work, and entertain ourselves. To this day, technology continues to change and improve, making our lives better. However, technology can’t change and improve on its own can it. Behind every change and improvement in technology lies the work of software engineers, the ones who design, develop, and maintain the software in every device and system we rely on daily. 
<h1>My Experience</h1>
  All my life, I have been around technology. I grew up watching television, playing Nintendo games, and having conversations with friends and family through digital devices. One day it struck, how does it work? How can technology impact our lives this much? Therefore I was inspired to do something that was related to technology when I grew up. 
  My first ever “technology” related class was a coding class in High School. It was a 4 year course however I only took 2 years worth of that course due to me not knowing that my school provides a course like this. The first year/level was an introduction class to programming for those that are interested in computer science. This class taught us some Logic, Composition and Decomposition in algorithms, Python, HTML, and CSS. The second year/level was a continuation of the first year however it focuses on advanced coding with JavaScript. Those 2 years sparked a passion for programming that led me to continue pursuing it in college.
  My college experience has really deepened my understanding of programming. I have had the opportunity to work on some projects that explore new areas of programming like Data Structures, Algorithms, and software development. These projects have impacted me and developed my passion for software development. One of the things that excites me about software development is the aspect of problem solving, figuring out the problem and finding different varieties of solutions to that single problem. 
<h1>Present</h1>
  Overall, it has been a journey from youth to now. From being inspired by technology to a student of software engineering. I have come to understand the impact technology has had, especially software development on our world. My experience from high school to college has significantly enhanced my coding skills and deepened my passion for this field. Going forward, I hope to further develop my skills and I am excited to learn new things in the field of software engineering.
